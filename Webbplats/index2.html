<h2> Ed Sheeran </h2>
<p> Early life </p>
Ever wonder how Ed Sheeran’s life story goes like? Well, he – like many of us
– didn’t have it easy. Dealing with his fair share of struggles from bullying,
to inner battles, insecurity and shame, to becoming an award-winning
singer, Ed Sheeran’s story shows how the artist learned to embrace his
uniqueness and overcame his challenges in order to bring us one of the
most beautiful voices of our time.

The English singer, songwriter, and guitarist is loved by young and old
everywhere across the world. His voice gathers people together, even those
who usually don’t prefer this type of music. He appeared on stage as a
shy ginger boy, but instantly won the hearts of everyone listening. And
that was just the beginning. Let’s take a closer look at the struggles
and wins of pop superstar Ed Sheeran.
Edward Christopher Sheeran was born in February 1991 in Halifax, England.
He had one older brother and his parents were running an art consultancy
at the time.
While he struggled with socializing in school, he had an interest in music
from a very young age. He became part of a church choir at 4 and soon
started playing the guitar. At 11 he was already writing songs, which was
inspired by a backstage chat with Damien Rice. Not only was his love for
 music obvious, but also his talent started being noticed by others around him.
<p> Career </p>
Speech therapy wasn’t going well and one of his biggest fears was that he’ll
be like that for the rest of his life. But things changed when one day his
dad brought him Eminem’s record. Ed Sheeran was amazed by how fast the singer
was rapping. This inspired him and he learned every word by the time he was 10.
He began writing more of his own music, and suddenly his stutter was gone.
Ed knew music was his calling and he had to do something about it. So in
addition to playing the guitar and writing songs, he started performing in
different venues. Soon he had 12 shows in a week. That continued for four
years, and not long after he was already recording CDs and selling them.

At the age of 14, Ed Sheeran took his guitar, packed some clothes,
and headed to London to officially start his music career and see where it
can take him.
Being on the road was far from easy. He shares that when he couldn’t find
a couch for the night, he had to sleep in parks or in the subway. He
had some nights when he didn’t have any money for food and was often
on the verge of giving up. But he didn’t.
In London, he was playing in small venues, producing more of his own music,
releasing albums, auditioning and doing collaborations with singers he met
along the way. He played in more than 300 shows in 2009 alone.
The big leap was in 2010, and while it wouldn’t be possible without the hard
work and everything Ed Sheeran had done so far, social media made the success
of the boy happen faster.
Not many singers were leveraging the potential of social media channels
at the time, but Ed Sheeran quickly spotted (and leveraged) their potential.
He was posting his videos online, and one of them was noticed by the rapper
Example, who liked his style so much that he invited him to tour together.
That helped him grow his online presence more and more, and people across
the world started tuning in to his YouTube videos. Soon the media started
paying attention to the ginger boy with the guitar and the amazing voice,
and some big names and newspapers started mentioning him.
That allowed Ed Sheeran to start dreaming bigger. He knew that if he
wanted to see progress, he had to move to America.
He arrived in LA without a recording contract or a place to stay.
He began sending out his music to anyone he could reach out to, but
received no answers. Until one day, while on the show of a local
radio host, he was brought to the stage. Terrified, he started
playing. 12 minutes later, he got a standing ovation.
The host’s name was Jamie Foxx, who was so impressed that he let Ed
Sheeran use his recording studio. Not just that, but he also let the
boy crash on his couch for a few weeks.
After hitting #2 on iTunes with a new release, Ed was invited to work
with Atlantic Records. With their help, he created his label debut
studio album “+”. It immediately sold 102,000 copies and later that
year became the second best-selling debut album in the UK. A year
after the release of “+”, it had already sold more than a million copies.
After this instant hit, he collaborated with One Direction and Taylor
Swift. Another one of his songs, “I See Fire”, was used in the movie
The Hobbit.
His next album, “x”, including some of his biggest hits, came out in 2014,
and went straight to #1 in the US and UK. Thanks to one of them, in 2016
he won the Grammy Award for Best Song of The Year.
