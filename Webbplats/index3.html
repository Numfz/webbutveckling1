<h2> John Mayer </h2>
<p> Early life </p>
Mayer was born on October 16, 1977, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to
Richard (a high-school principal) and Margaret Mayer (a middle-school
English teacher).[8] He grew up in nearby Fairfield, the middle child
between older brother Carl and younger brother Ben. His father is Jewish,
and Mayer has said that he relates to Judaism. As a middle school
student, Mayer became close friends with future tennis star James Blake,
and they often played Nintendo together after school.[12] He attended the
Center for Global Studies at Brien McMahon High School in Norwalk for his
junior year (then known as the Center for Japanese Studies Abroad, a
magnet program for learning Japanese).
After watching Michael J. Fox's guitar performance as Marty McFly
in Back to the Future, Mayer became fascinated with the instrument.
When he turned 13, his father rented one for him. A neighbor gave Mayer
a Stevie Ray Vaughan cassette, which cultivated Mayer's love of blues
music. According to Mayer, his fascination with Vaughan started a
"genealogical hunt" that led him to other blues guitarists, including
Buddy Guy, B.B. King, Freddie King, Albert King, Otis Rush and Lightnin'
Hopkins. Mayer started taking lessons from a local guitar-shop owner,
Al Ferrante, and soon became consumed. His singular focus 
concerned his parents, and they twice took him to see a psychiatrist,
who determined him to be healthy. Mayer says that his parents'
contentious marriage led him to "disappear and create my own world I
could believe in". After two years of practice, he started playing
at bars and other venues, while still in high school. In addition to
performing solo, he was a member of a band called Villanova Junction
(named for a Jimi Hendrix song) with Tim Procaccini, Joe Beleznay and
Rich Wolf.
