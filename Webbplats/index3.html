<h2> John Mayer </h2>
<p> Early life </p>
Mayer was born on October 16, 1977, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to
Richard (a high-school principal) and Margaret Mayer (a middle-school
English teacher). He grew up in nearby Fairfield, the middle child
between older brother Carl and younger brother Ben. His father is Jewish,
and Mayer has said that he relates to Judaism. As a middle school
student, Mayer became close friends with future tennis star James Blake,
and they often played Nintendo together after school. He attended the
Center for Global Studies at Brien McMahon High School in Norwalk for his
junior year (then known as the Center for Japanese Studies Abroad, a
magnet program for learning Japanese).
After watching Michael J. Fox's guitar performance as Marty McFly
in Back to the Future, Mayer became fascinated with the instrument.
When he turned 13, his father rented one for him. A neighbor gave Mayer
a Stevie Ray Vaughan cassette, which cultivated Mayer's love of blues
music. According to Mayer, his fascination with Vaughan started a
"genealogical hunt" that led him to other blues guitarists, including
Buddy Guy, B.B. King, Freddie King, Albert King, Otis Rush and Lightnin'
Hopkins. Mayer started taking lessons from a local guitar-shop owner,
Al Ferrante, and soon became consumed. His singular focus
concerned his parents, and they twice took him to see a psychiatrist,
who determined him to be healthy. Mayer says that his parents'
contentious marriage led him to "disappear and create my own world I
could believe in". After two years of practice, he started playing
at bars and other venues, while still in high school. In addition to
performing solo, he was a member of a band called Villanova Junction
(named for a Jimi Hendrix song) with Tim Procaccini, Joe Beleznay and
Rich Wolf.
<p> Career </p>
Mayer considered skipping college to pursue his music, but his parents
dissuaded him. He enrolled in the Berklee College of Music in 1997
at age 19. At the urging of his college friend Clay Cook, they left
Berklee after two semesters and moved to Atlanta. There, they formed
a two-man band called LoFi Masters, and began performing in local coffee
houses and club venues such as Eddie's Attic. According to Cook, they
experienced musical differences due to Mayer's desire to move more towards
pop music.The two parted ways and Mayer embarked on a solo career.

With the help of local producer and engineer Glenn Matullo, Mayer recorded
the independent EP Inside Wants Out. The EP includes eight songs with Mayer
on lead vocals and guitars. For the opening track, "Back To You", a full
band was enlisted, including the EP's co-producer David "DeLa" LaBruyere
on bass guitars. Cook had co-written many of the album's songs,
including its first commercial single release, "No Such Thing",
However, his only performance contribution was backing vocals on
the song "Comfortable".

Mayer and LaBruyere performed throughout Georgia and nearby states.
Also, as his career coincided with the then-nascent internet music
market, Mayer benefited from an online following. Mayer came to the
attention of Gregg Latterman at Aware Records through an acquaintance
of Mayer's, a lawyer, who sent Aware his EP. After including him in
Aware Festival concerts and his songs on Aware compilations, in early
2001, Aware released Mayer's internet-only album titled, Room for
Squares. During this time, Aware concluded a deal with Columbia Records
that gave Columbia first pick in signing Aware artists. In September,
Columbia remixed and re-released Room for Squares. As part of the major
label "debut", the album's artwork was updated, and the track "3x5"
was added. The re-release included reworked studio versions of the
first four songs from Inside Wants Out.

By the end of 2002, Room for Squares had spawned several radio hits,
including "No Such Thing", "Your Body Is a Wonderland", and ultimately,
"Why Georgia". It also received general praise critically, and Mayer
drew comparisons to Dave Matthews. In 2003, Mayer won a Grammy
for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for "Your Body Is a Wonderland".
In his acceptance speech he remarked, "This is very, very fast, and
I promise to catch up". He also figuratively referred to himself
as being sixteen, a remark that many mistook to mean that he was
sixteen years old at the time.

In February 2003, Mayer released a live CD and DVD of a concert in Birmingham,
Alabama titled Any Given Thursday, which included songs previously not
recorded, such as "Man on the Side", "Something's Missing", and Covered
in Rain". Commercially, the album peaked at number 17 on the Billboard
200 chart.[citation needed] Its accompanying DVD release received
conservative—although consistent—praise, with critics torn between
his pop-idol image, and (at the time) emerging guitar prowess.Erik
Crawford of AllMusic asked, "Is [Mayer] the consummate guitar hero
exemplified when he plays a cover of Stevie Ray Vaughan's 'Lenny',
or is he the teen idol that the pubescent girls shriek for after he
plays 'Your Body Is a Wonderland?That summer, Mayer went
on the road with Counting Crows in a tour that spanned 42 dates between
July 7 and September 2.
