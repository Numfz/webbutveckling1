<h2> Keith Urban </h2>
<p> Early life </p>
Keith Lionel Urban was born on 26 October 1967, in Whangarei, New Zealand,
 He is the youngest son of Marienne and Robert "Bob" Urban. At the age of 13,
 he attended Sir Edmund Hillary College in Otara, South Auckland,
 New Zealand and by the age of 17, he lived with his parents in Caboolture,
Queensland, Australia. His father, who owned a convenience store, put an
advertisement for a guitar teacher in his shop window.
Urban took lessons from his teacher, Sue McCarthy[6] and began entering
local competitions, in addition to acting in a local theater company.
Urban has stated that his guitar playing was influenced by two rock players,
 Mark Knopfler (Dire Straits) and Lindsey Buckingham (Fleetwood Mac).

In 1983, Urban was a contestant on the Australian TV talent show New Faces.
A few years later, he began making the inroads into the Australian country
music scene, with regular appearances on the Reg Lindsay Country Homestead
TV Program, Mike McClellan's Music Program, and various other TV programs
performing duets with local Brisbane girl Jenny Wilson. They won a Golden
Guitar award at the Tamworth Country Music Festival. Urban also performed
regularly on stage at the Northern Suburbs Country Music Club near Caboolture.
<p> Career </p>
1990–1999: Early years
In 1990, Urban signed with EMI in Australia and released his self-titled debut
album. He appeared on the 1990 compilation album Breaking Ground -
New Directions in Country Music which was nominated for the 1991 ARIA Award
for Best Country Album.He toured as a backup act to Slim Dusty between
1993 and 1994. In the mid-1990s, both people recorded a re-worked duet of
Dusty's classic "Lights on the Hill". Urban appeared for the first time at
the Grand Ole Opry backing Dusty. He also sang backing vocals on INXS's
live album Live Baby Live (1992).

Urban moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 1992. The next year, he appeared in
the music video for Alan Jackson's rendition of "Mercury Blues". He and
Vernon Rust co-wrote "Jesus Gets Jealous of Santa Claus" on Toby Keith's
1995 album Christmas to Christmas, 4 Runner's 1996 single "That Was
Him (This Is Now)", and "Tangled Up in Love" on the Raybon Brothers'
1997 self-titled album.[13] In 1997, he formed a band known as The Ranch,
which included drummer Peter Clarke and bassist Jerry Flowers. The Ranch
released one self-titled album for Capitol Records Nashville and charted
two singles on the Hot Country Songs charts that year: "Walkin' the
Country" and "Just Some Love". Throughout the late 1990s, Urban
also played guitar on several other artists' albums, such as Paul
Jefferson, Tim Wilson, and Charlie Daniels.

1999–2001: Keith Urban
Urban released his self-titled American debut album in 1999 under the
production of session pianist Matt Rollings. It was led by the number 18
single "It's a Love Thing", followed by the number-four "Your Everything",
which made him the first male New Zealand performer to reach the Top 10
on the US country charts. Its follow-up, "But for the Grace of God",
written by Charlotte Caffey and Jane Wiedlin of The Go-Go's, became his
first number 1 hit on the charts. The last single, "Where the Blacktop
Ends", written by Steve Wariner and Allen Shamblin, went to number three.
He won the Top New Male Vocalist Award at the 2001 Academy of Country
Music Awards and the 2001 Country Music Association's Horizon Award.
Allmusic's Thom Jurek described the first and third singles favorably,
and praised the instrumental track "Rollercoaster", saying that
Urban was "flat picking his Stratocaster like it was another
extremity he was born with." He thought that those songs "balance
the slick and sometimes too-soft production on the record".

2002–2006: Golden Road & Be Here
Urban released his second American album Golden Road in 2002.
Of the 13 songs included on this album, Urban produced seven himself
and co-produced the other six with Dann Huff. The album's lead-off
single "Somebody Like You" was released in July 2002 and spent six weeks
at number-one. The second single was the number-three hit "Raining on
Sunday", which Radney Foster had previously released as a single from
his 1998 album See What You Want to See. The third and fourth
singles from the album, "Who Wouldn't Wanna Be Me" and "You'll Think
of Me", went to number-one, with the latter winning him the Grammy
Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 2005.
On 22 September 2005, Urban's third studio album Golden Road was
certified triple platinum, for sales of three million copies.
In 2002, Urban posed nude for Playgirl. On the Tonight Show with Jay Leno,
he stated on that he regrets posing nude despite not showing any full
frontal nudity.
Urban performed "Lights on the Hill" for Tamworth's 2004 tribute concert
 following the death of Australia's Slim Dusty, an artist whom he had both
 written for and covered.
In 2005, Urban performed in front of European audiences for the first
time. In May, Urban supported Bryan Adams on his UK and Ireland tour,
which included dates in Earls Court, London, SECC, Glasgow and The Point,
Dublin. On 6 June a UK only album, Days Go By, was released. The album
contained songs from both Be Here and Golden Road.
"You Look Good in My Shirt" was originally intended to be the fifth
single from this album. Instead, Capitol chose to release "Days Go By",
the lead-off to his third American album Be Here. By late 2004, this
song became Urban's fifth number-one hit on the country chart. Although
it was not officially released, "You Look Good in My Shirt" spent
one-week at number 60 on the country charts in July 2004 and
remained a fan favorite. The next single from this album was the #2
"You're My Better Half", followed by the five-week number 1
"Making Memories of Us", which was written by Rodney Crowell and
previously recorded by both Tracy Byrd and Crowell's side project
The Notorious Cherry Bombs.[28] The next singles from this album were
"Better Life" and "Tonight I Wanna Cry". The former, which Urban wrote
with Richard Marx, spent six weeks at number 1 and the latter spent
three weeks at number 2. After this song, "Live to Love Another Day"
spent 14 weeks on the country chart, reaching a peak of number 48,
although it was never officially released as a single.
